Size
Size is probably the most obvious consideration when selecting a van. NZ has some requirements for self containment that means it is necessary to consider space and layout in order to comply. 
Smaller vans will usually require more time spent "transforming" spaces from one use to another. Smaller vans will also lend themselves better to use of the outside of the van for cooking, cleanding and dining. Larger vans will gradually enable more activities to be undertaken inside.

We would classify the sizes of vans as follows:

Small - any minivan model (Estima, Vellfire, Odyessy )
Medium - Hiace, bongo, econovan
Large - Crafter, Transit, Sprinter
Extra Large - XL 

Use
think about your circumstances and what you will likely use the Campervan for. Are you a local resident escaping the city on weekends and short camping trips. Will you be spending a couple of months travelling around and need something for good and bad weather. Or are you planning to use it as a home away from home? Are you handy? Will working on the Camper be a pleasure or a chore?

If your use is more temporary and in finer weather seasons, you will be able to get away with something simpler and more economical. Be honest with your needs, its easy to get swept up in the instagram hype and want more than you need.

If your holiday is trips are time constrained, you are driving a lot, using caravan parks arriving late, leaving early and touring all day stopping at roadhouses for convenience, it is probably most appropriate to use a small camper.

If time is less of a concern and you will be spending more time in fixed locations, setting up more permanent camp in a moderate size van will make you all the more comfortable.

Cost
Costs will generally increase exponentially as the size of the van increases. Larger vans will be generally more expensive require more costly maintainence, attract higher taxes and road use charges and higher fuel consumption.

Handling/Drivability
Are you driving in to town a lot? do you need to be able to street park the van? go into parking garages? 

Will you have multiple drivers? Larger vehicles can be intimidating to drive. Generally, if driving with a companion, one will be more confident driving the vehicle. Naturally they will do more of the driving attracting more expirience and confidence. This will create a feedback loop that forms a strong disinsentive to share the driving. Ideally driving should be split as equitably as possible to break the journey up and make travelling a pleasure. The co-pilot usually doing the research for next locations to stay. 

Safety
Often overlooked compared to the size and cost components its worth saying that the cheaper and larger the van is, it is likely that it compromises on safety for being an older vehicle and/or a poorer design.
