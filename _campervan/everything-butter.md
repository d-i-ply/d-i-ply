Ex DHL van converted to a campervan in 5 days!

We purchased a van while on Holiday in Europe. We were on a tight timeline to get the van, fit it out and drive from Eastern Europe (Latvia) to Western Europe (Spain) and back in 3 months. 

We got the van and 3D scanned the interior. While it was at the mechainic's being serviced, we designed and had a CNC fabrication company cut out the components. Stripout, wall insulation and lining, flooring and installation of cabinets done in 5 days. Some of the plumbing and electrical work took a little longer and was completed while we were travelling. 

Since completing this project we have updated the design. These updates refine the design, add new features and make assembly much easier.  We hope to sell a plan set and instructions for this design for a modest price. The plan set will include full CAD files and guides so anyone can get the kit fabricated locally. Using this plans and our instructions it will be fast straight forward and cost effective to complete your build project.

Please comment if you are interested in the plans and we will notify you when they become available.
