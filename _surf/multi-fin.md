Multi-fin Surfrack

Hold your boards high and display them with pride. Don't hide your boards in the garage, bring them into your living space to be shown-off like the works of art that they are. 

The product is perfect for mounting over couches, or other furniture to make the best use of your living space. 

The rack comes in single, twin, thruster (3) and quad variants.  The design uses some clever joints to make assembly a breeze.
