The wave

This rack tells stories of surfing.
One of the stories is the story of the humble wave. As the wave travels it develops through its different stages. Starting as a simple hump of surging water, the wave steepens, peaks and breaks. Understanding the story of the wave is an important step for any aspiring surfer.

The rack can also tell the story of your surfing. As you progress your skills and move through development you will start to accumulate new and more advanced boards. The rack can also tell this story displaying multiple boards recording the story of your surfing journey.
