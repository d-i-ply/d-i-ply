MakerFaire Wellington 2018 was New Zealand's inaugural MakerFaire. The MakerFaire is an export from "Make:" magazine the world's pre-eminent magazine for hobbies and crafts. MakerFaires are held in dozens of cities around the world and celebrate the collision of art and science.

d-i-ply shared a corner with our good friends from the  Hackland Hackerspace and we both drew quite a crowd. It was a great opportunity to talk to other makers from around New Zealand and explain the d-i-ply project. I am pleased to report that d-i-ply was very enthusiastically received by other Makers, the public and the MakerFaire event organisers. We were even lucky enough to win the illustrious award: "Maker of Merit" an award given to the three most impactful exhibits. What a wrap!
