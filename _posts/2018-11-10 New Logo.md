Yay!

We have our new logo. 

We have also gotten some graphics made up to demonstrate the key stages of our process.

1. Designed by the Community. 



2. Manufactured by us.



3. Assembled by you 



I am really happy with the way it turned out. The website looks much more consistent and cohesive. 

Again, I have to thank Shannon shannoncant.com from Artful Alignment artfulalignment.com for her good work!
