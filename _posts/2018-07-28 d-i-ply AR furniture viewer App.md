Buying things online always carries a bit of uncertainty. This is true for tactile objects like furniture and clothing, even more true for moderate to high value purchases AND especially true for non-mass produced goods.

This is totally understandable. It is only natural to want to see something in three dimensions, walk around it and see how it interacts with its environment. We recognise that this fact is a real challenge for our business. Fortunately, we have some tricks up our sleeves...

Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that is quickly maturing and offers a way to reduce some of the uncertainty when purchasing physical goods online. Lately, several tools have been release that enable developement of applications that are stable, performant and straight forward to create. The ubiquiry of powerful phones also means that an inceasing portion of the population will be able to view AR content on their devices.

To date AR has not become a mainstream technology with the exceptions of social media selfie 'filters' and the short lived fad pokemon go. Soon the novelty factor for this technology will wear off and it will be just another tool in helping to communicate. Tech-industry commentary on AR technology frequently points out trialing furniture as an example application. In my own humble opinion, I think that is quite likely that most furniture sales in the future will involve some kind of AR interaction prior to sale.

It may be that AR helps short-list designs prior to observing the products in real life showroom, or that the showroom could be bypassed if confidence or certain guarantees of quaility can be given.



As an experiment we have developed an demonstation Android application to show case the use of this technology with our designs. Currently only the "Lean-ah" shoe rack is available.
