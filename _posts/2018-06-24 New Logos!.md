Putting it Together - Radio Interview in the Commiunity Garden with 95bFM

d-i-ply has been lucky to be interviewed by Auckland Community Radio 95bFM http://95bfm.com/. We were featured on the segment community garden which is dedicated to interviewing community spaces and projects.  Below is a link to the audio from the radio interview. We discuss the mission of d-i-ply as a mechanism to join independent designers manufacturing and D.I.Y.-ers.
