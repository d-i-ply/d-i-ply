These are gallery tests for image wrapped in `<figure>` elements.

To place a gallery add the necessary YAML Front Matter:

And then drop-in the gallery include --- gallery `caption` is optional.

{% include gallery caption="This is a sample gallery with **Markdown support**." %}

This is some text after the gallery just to make sure that everything aligns properly.
